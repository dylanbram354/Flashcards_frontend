# Overview

This web application was created as an assignment for devCodeCamp, focusing on the implementation of React Hooks. It is a fully functioning flashcard application, allowing users to create their own virtual flashcards and organize them into "stacks". Users can select a stack and then scroll through all flashcards in that stack. Each flashcard displays a prompt or vocabulary term on the front. Users can either "flip" the cards to display the answer on the back, or they can type in their answers and be told whether or not they are correct. The application tracks the number of correct answers for each stack and displays the users' score.
